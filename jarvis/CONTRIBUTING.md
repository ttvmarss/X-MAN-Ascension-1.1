# Contributing to JARVIS

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Here's how to get involved.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Follow the setup instructions in the README
4. Make your changes
5. Test that JARVIS still works (start the server, talk to him)
6. Submit a PR

## What We're Looking For

- **Bug fixes** — if something's broken, fix it
- **New integrations** — Spotify, Slack, Notion, etc.
- **Windows/Linux support** — the AppleScript integrations are macOS-only, cross-platform alternatives welcome
- **Better error handling** — things fail silently in places
- **Voice improvements** — alternative TTS providers, better speech recognition
- **New actions** — extend what JARVIS can do

## Code Style

Yes, `server.py` is a 2400-line monolith. It works. If you want to refactor parts into modules, that's welcome — just make sure nothing breaks.

- Keep voice responses short (1-2 sentences max)
- Don't add dependencies unless necessary
- Test your changes by actually talking to JARVIS
- Keep the personality consistent — British butler, dry wit, economy of language

## What NOT to Do

- Don't add telemetry or analytics
- Don't send data to external services beyond the existing API calls (Anthropic, Fish Audio)
- Don't add features that modify or delete user data in connected services (Mail, Calendar, Notes)
- Don't break the existing voice loop

## Reporting Issues

Open an issue with:
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Your OS and Python version
- Any error messages from the terminal

## Questions?

Open an issue or start a discussion. Keep it simple.
